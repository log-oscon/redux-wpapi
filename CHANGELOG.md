# Changelog

The following highlights the changes that have been rolled with each new release.

Some guidelines in reading this document:

* The `[new release]` section corresponds to all the changes that have been merged into master, but have not yet been packaged and released.
* Every other release has it's section whose title is the tag of the release.
* The changes on each release are a list of Pull Requests (PRs) which were merged into master. For every PR we have the short summary followed by a link to the actual merged PR page. Inside the PR are the detailed changes.
* Being that these are the early days of the repository, we have some code changes that were added directly and without much detail, for these we have a link to the commit instead of the PR.
* Annotations starting with **[BC]** indicates breaking change.

## [new release]
* Fix [#29](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/29): Reuse same promise for two identical subsequential GET requests where the first wasn't resolved yet. ([#31](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/31))

## 1.3.3
* WPAPI adapter: body of modifying requests wasn't being sent due a typo.

## 1.3.2
* Fix [#26](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/26): Incoming partial resources shouldn't change the complete resource in cache to partial, just update it. ([#27](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/27))

## 1.3.1
* Fix: Ensures pagination shape and presence in response. ([#25](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/25))
* Fix TTL behavior: It now can be overriden by the consumer when dispatching `callAPI` ([#24](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/24))

## 1.3.0
* ([#22](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/22))
    * Adapter's `getAggregator` is now applied per resource and has `additionalData` in order decide, which might be either the query of the request or the resource itself.
    * `getAggregator` setting is now available, so consumer might also decide per resource. As its third param, the `suggestedAggregator` is supplied contain the adapter's `getAggregator` return.

## 1.2.1
* ([#21](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/21))
    * Mark embedded resource as `partial` until they are fetched individually (closes [#20](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/20))
    * Fix indexation: type no longer matters in `getLocalResourceID`

## 1.2.0
* Fix [#15](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/15) - Support for register dashed-routes as camelCase ([#16](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/16))
* TTL (Time-to-live) now can be overriden by each request. ([#17](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/17))
* [#13](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/13)
  * **[BC]** - `selectQuery` renamed to `selectRequest` and now also accepts `{ cacheID, page }` for selecting Requests
  * **[BC]** - Ommits `localResources`, now that a denormalization methods exists.
  * Exposes `selectRequestRaw`, so a request might be selected without denormalization step
  * Fix [#12](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/12) â€“ Promise returned from middleware dispatch was overlaping responses with same name
  * Fix [#14](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/14) - lastCacheUpdate should be used as Symbol for preventing collisions, now been tested
* Fix [#18](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/issues/18) - Allow indexation of resources without indexers (such as id or custom indexers) [#19](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/19)

## 1.1.0

* Expose a denormalization mechanism so consumer can transform local ids into resources denormalized ([#11](https://github.com/log-oscon/redux-wpapi/pull/11))
